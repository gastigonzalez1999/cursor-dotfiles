# NestJS Code Review — Continuous Quality Gate

This skill activates whenever you review, modify, or create NestJS source files. It enforces the project's quality standards on every change.

## Pre-Change Checklist

Before modifying any file, complete these steps:

1. **Read related tests** — Find and read existing test files for the module you're changing (`*.spec.ts`, `*.e2e-spec.ts`)
2. **Understand module boundaries** — Check the module's imports/exports to understand what's available and what other modules depend on it
3. **Check for existing patterns** — Look at sibling files in the same module to match existing conventions (naming, error handling, DTO structure)

## Post-Change Validation Checklist

After every code change, verify ALL of the following. Items marked **(blocking)** must be fixed before declaring the change complete.

### Response DTOs & Serialization

- [ ] **(blocking)** Every controller method returns a **response DTO**, never a raw entity
- [ ] **(blocking)** Response DTOs use `@Exclude()` on the class and `@Expose()` only on safe fields
- [ ] Response DTOs have a static `fromEntity()` factory method
- [ ] `@ApiResponse({ type: ResponseDto })` references the response DTO, not the entity

### Swagger / OpenAPI

- [ ] **(blocking)** Every new/modified endpoint has `@ApiOperation()` and `@ApiResponse()` decorators
- [ ] **(blocking)** Every new/modified endpoint has `@ApiTags()` on its controller
- [ ] DTO properties have `@ApiProperty()` decorators with meaningful descriptions
- [ ] Error responses are documented (`@ApiResponse({ status: 404, description: '...' })`)

### Validation

- [ ] **(blocking)** Every input DTO has `class-validator` decorators on all fields
- [ ] Update DTOs use `PartialType()` from `@nestjs/swagger` (not `@nestjs/mapped-types`) to preserve Swagger metadata
- [ ] Array and nested object fields use `@ValidateNested()` + `@Type()`

### Code Quality

- [ ] **(blocking)** No `console.log` — use NestJS `Logger` instead (`private readonly logger = new Logger(ClassName.name)`)
- [ ] **(blocking)** No `any` types — use proper interfaces or generics
- [ ] **(blocking)** No floating promises — every async call is `await`ed or explicitly handled with `.catch()`
- [ ] **(blocking)** No `eslint-disable` comments or `@ts-ignore` — fix the underlying issue
- [ ] No hardcoded configuration values — use `@nestjs/config` ConfigService
- [ ] Constructor injection only — no property injection with `@Inject()`

### Architecture

- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced — check module imports form a DAG
- [ ] Services export from their module's `exports` array (not the module itself)
- [ ] New providers are decorated with `@Injectable()`
- [ ] Feature code is organized by domain (`src/<feature>/`), not by technical layer
- [ ] Entity relationships use proper ORM decorators with cascade rules matching the domain model in CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Related entities are loaded eagerly or via explicit `relations` option in find queries (no N+1 queries)
- [ ] New entities are documented in CLAUDE.md's Entity Field Reference, Relationships, and Key Features sections
- [ ] Custom endpoints defined in the entity model have corresponding e2e test coverage

### Testing

- [ ] **(blocking)** Tests are updated for any changed public method or endpoint
- [ ] New endpoints have at least a controller spec testing the happy path
- [ ] Mocks use `jest.fn()` or `createMock()` — no real database/network calls in unit tests
- [ ] Test descriptions are specific: `'should return 404 when user not found'` not `'should work'`

### Security

- [ ] Sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, internal IDs) are never exposed in API responses
- [ ] New endpoints that require authentication use `@UseGuards()`
- [ ] User input that reaches database queries is validated and sanitized via DTOs

## Mandatory Verification Step

Before declaring any change complete, run:

```bash
npm run lint && npm run test
```

If either command fails, fix the issues before proceeding. Do not skip this step.
